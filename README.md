# odin-recipes

This is the first project that I created while going through The Odin Project. In it I demonstrate what basic skills I have learned in regards to HTML basics. These skills are: 
1. How to format a basic layout for an HTML page (adding !DOCTYPE, html, head and body tags in the appropriate order and places).
2. What code is important to put in the head of a page (title, meta charset).
3. How to set up the basic body of an HTML page (headings, paragraphs, lists).
